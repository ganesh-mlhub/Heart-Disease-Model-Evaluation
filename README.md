# Heart Disease Model Evaluation

## Task 5: Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics

### Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn

### Dataset
- Heart Disease Dataset (heart.csv)

### Steps Performed
1. Loaded heart disease dataset
2. Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%)
3. Trained Logistic Regression model
4. Predicted test data
5. Evaluated model using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
6. Explained confusion matrix

### Outcome
- Learned how to evaluate machine learning models
- Understood importance of train-test split
